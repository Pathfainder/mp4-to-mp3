mp4-to-mp3 as simple as it sounds..

I just needed to get the audio of (very) long files and didn't manage to find a free service online so here it is ! ;)

# Installation :

1. Clone this repo to your project:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Pathfainder/mp4-to-mp3.git
```

2. (optinal) Create a new Python environment in your project folder :
```bash
py -m venv your_env_name
```

3. Install `moviepy` to allow video processing :
```bash
pip install moviepy
```
4. Click on the adress bar on top of your folder and type `cmd`.
   
5. Activate your python environment :
   ```bash
   your_env_name\scripts\activate
   
6. Run :
```bash
py extract_gui.py
```

9. Enjoy ! ;)
